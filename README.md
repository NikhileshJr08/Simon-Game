## About

  This is just a small project done by me to practice more of javaScript :man_facepalming:
  
### Rules and Regulations 

  It's pretty simple and easy to play. You just have to press a key to start and a colour out of the four colours :blue_square: :red_square: :yellow_square: 	:green_square:  will get highlighted. You just have to press the highlighted colour and remember the sequence. Trust me, it gets interesting once you reach level 10.
